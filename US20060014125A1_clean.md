## WALKING  THROUGH  WALLS  TRAINING SYSTEM

## BRIEF  SUMMARY  OF  THE  INVENTION

0001. This invention is a training system that enables a human  being  to  acquire  Sufficient  hyperspace  energy  in  order to  pull  the  body  out  of  dimension  So  that  the  perSon  can  walk through Solid objects Such as wooden  doors.

## BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION

0002. A  human  being  is a  hyperspace  energy  being  living in a physical container or body that is comprised of 67% water. This high percentage of  water makes this invention possible. Referring to FIG. 1, the hyperSpace energy being receives  energy from our  dimension through  Seven  Vortices that run the length of  the body. Each Vortex connects to a Separate hyperSpace dimension having its own particular frequency. This arrangement  allows  for  the development  of Seven modular energy components corresponding to  the mind, Spiritual eye, Voice, body, abdomen, plasma energy ball (battery), and  ground  connection.

0003 Vortex (A), known as the  top  vortex,  Supplies energy to the mind and  provides a channel of  communica tion to other  entities in the universe. This  channel  has  been tested  up  to 100,000  light years  which  is  the diameter  of  the galaxy.

0004 Vortex  (B),  known  as  the  spiritual  eye,  has  a  hollow cone-like  appearance  surrounded by white,  misty,  low density hyperSpace energy. Because the eye is modular, the mind can project it to vast distances, a process known as remote viewing.

0005 Vortex (C), known  as  the voice and  hearing mod ule, can  also  be  projected to enormous  distances  in order  to communicate verbally with other entities. Using  the proper remote  Viewing  instruments,  it is  possible  to  project  both  the eye and  Verbal modules  to See and talk at the Same time.

0006 Vortex (D), known as the heart vortex, provides protective energy to the  upper internal organs, arms and hands.

0007 Vortex  (E)  provides  protective  energy  for  the  lower organs Such as the intestines, liver and  kidneyS.

0008 Vortex (F),  known as the  battery  of the  body, consists of  an  orange-colored  plasma  energy  ball about  one to two inches in diameter. The  body becomes  paralyzed if this ball is removed from the body. When  the hyperspace energy being leaves the body, the Vortices close and the battery takes  over  in  order  to  keep  the  body  functioning.  This Vortex also plays a role in the creation of  the astral energy baby that attaches to the fertilized egg.

0009 Vortex  (G)  is  the  ground  vortex  which  rotates  in  the counter-clockwise direction in order to provide an energy ground  for  the  electrical  circuit.  All  the other  Vortices rotate in the clockwise direction as Seen from the front Such that energy  flows  into  the  Vortex  according  to the right-hand  rule of  physics.

0010 Vortex  (H)  is the hand  vortex  which rotates coun terclockwise on the right hand and clockwise on the left hand as Seen looking at the palm. Thus there is a rotating flow  of  hyperSpace  energy  between  the two  hands  when  the palms  are facing  each other.

0011 Referring  to FIG.  2,  each  vortex  feeds  energy  into its own  hyperspace module shown by the lettered box. In terms  of  quantum  mechanics,  each  box  is actually a  potential energy well in which each module develops separately. At the time of death of the body, these modules are joined together  as  a  Single  energy  being.  The  process  is  powered  by the  plasma energy ball battery  which also  contains the logical instructions for assembly.

0012. Different  people,  as tested  by  the pendulum  on  the hand  vortex,  have different vortex  sizes. Three  people were tested. The first perSon had  almost no rotational movement showing  very little energy. The  Second  perSon  had  a Vortex radius of one inch. Another had a Vortex radius of four inches  which  covered  his  entire hand.  The  latter also  has  the ability to  lift another  human  being,  lying  prone  on  a  table,  off the table by  flowing  low-density  hyperspace  energy into the person through the hand  Vortices. He  has also experienced walking  through  a  Solid wooden  door  with a  dog  at his  Side. What  this means  is that there is a way, as described in this invention,  of creating  large  energy  Vortices  which will enable a person to acquire Sufficient energy to walk  out of dimension through Solid objects Such as wooden  doors.

0013 Researching  the historical records, referring to the statue in FIG.  3, a humble black Catholic Dominican friar of  the  Santo  Rosario  Convent,  by  the name  of  San  Martin  de Porres, living in Peru in the  1500's, also developed this ability to walk through doors. For his beatification, many witnesses came forward to recount his extraordinary abili ties.  For example, a witness, who  worked in the Convent, went  to the cell of  San  Martin to ask  for something  to eat. When  he reached the cell, he saw  San Martin leaving with Some medications apparently  to  heal Someone sick. The witness waited by the open door of  the cell for his return. After having waited awhile without being distracted by anything else, he saw said venerable brother fray Martin come  out  from  his  cell  from  the  inside and  call  him  by  name. The witneSS was  terrified, not understanding how  this was possible.

0014. The  woman  who  gave  me  the statue told  me  that  he would  walk  miles  and  miles  each  day  to visit the poor. The task of walking means that there  is  a Velocity involved. Because the body has mass, then there is a mass times a velocity, or momentum,  involved  in this ability. Notice also that  the  Statue  shows  him  walking  with  his  right  arm  crossed over his left arm in the form of  an X.

0015 What  this walking momentum means in terms of physics is given  in the following  analysis. The  human  body consists of 67% water. A  water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom having the atomic formula HO.  The atomic weight of  one atom of  hydrogen is 1.008 awu. The atomic weight of one atom of  oxygen is 16.000  awu.  The molecular weight of  one atom  of  water is therefore:

| Weight of two atoms of hydrogen 2 x 1.008 awu = Weight of one atom of oxygen 1 x 16.000 awu =   | 2.016 awu 16.000 awu 18.016 awu   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

The formula weight is just the atomic weight expressed in grams. Thus  the formula weight of  water would  be 18.016

grams  or  0.01801.6  kilograms.  According  to  Avogadro's  law, the formula weight contains N=6.02x10°  molecules. Thus the  mass of one water molecule is  the  formula weight divided by  the number  of  molecules:

0016. According  to Einstein's  Special  Theory  of  Relativ ity,  energy is  equal to the mass times the Speed of light Squared.  The energy  of a photon  is  equal  to  Planck's constant h times the frequency f of the photon. Equating these two  energies shows  that

<!-- image -->

which Says that the natural logarithm of  the mass  plus the natural logarithm of  the wavelength is equal to the natural logarithm of  Planck's  constant  divided  by  the speed  of  light c, known as the base constant in the tetrahedron diagram. This diagram plots the mass verSuS wavelength in natural logarithms. Notice that the left hand  side of  the equation is the  Sum  of  mass  and  wavelength,  So  the right  hand  Side must also be the Same.

<!-- image -->

where  S2A,  known  as  the Planck maSS, is the linear mass  S2 of the universe times the bottom dimensional limit of the universe A,  and  2.  LA  is the  bottom  dimensional  wavelength, known as the Planck wavelength. That is, our dimension is bounded  by the Planck box  having sides Planck mass and Planck wavelength. These boundaries have values:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

0017 Referring  to FIG.  4,  these two  lines  are plotted on the tetrahedron diagram.  The Planck mass  line (A) reflects off  the  sphere  (C)  and  returns  as  the Planck  wavelength  (B) which shows the  dual nature  of quantum physics. This creates  the  Planck  box  (a,b,c,d)  which  is  the  boundary  of  our dimension.

0018 Referring to FIG.  5, the mass of the water mol ecule is plotted as horizontal line (D) on the diagram. The energy of  the water molecule is the mass  times  the Speed of light Squared.

<!-- image -->

0019 Referring to  FIG. 6, a circle (E), having a radius equal  to the Speed  of  light  Squared,  centered  on  the mass  of the water  molecule  at  the  vertical axis,  generates  a  circle (F), centered at the origin, that intersects (e) the mass of the water molecule  at  the  Planck wavelength. That is,  this interSection point sits  right on the  Planck box boundary between space and hyperspace. The radius of circle (F) is actually  the mass  of  the  water  molecule  divided  by  the  speed of  light Squared.

<!-- image -->

Taking the positive Square root, the Speed of light is one meter  per  Second at the Planck  boundary. The  experiments with brain hemisphere resonance show that the  resonant frequency  of  the human  energy  field  is  between  1 Hz  to 5  Hz which  is well  below  the hearing  threshold  of  20  Hz. Because the traveling wave has a wavelength of 0.3048 m  and the Speed  of  light  is unity at  the  boundary,  the frequency  should be

<!-- image -->

which  is within the middle of  the experimental  male range. At  this resonant  frequency,  the human  energy  being  pops  out of  the body. This  represents only a first stage in the devel opment  of the energy being. But  what  is really wanted  is to have both the physical body  and the energy field move  out of  dimension together as  San Martin did.

0020 Referring  to FIG.  7, the  45° base  line  (G)  is added to the diagram. Notice that the Planck mass  intersects (b.d) the Planck  wavelength on this line because they sum  to the base constant. The  mass  of  the water  molecule  crosses this line at point  (f). A circle,  centered  (f), with a radius  equal  to the Speed of  light, is tangent to the Planck wavelength (h) and the  Planck mass (g).  Since  mass times Velocity  is momentum, the diagram Says that the  momentum of the water molecule is tangent to the boundaries of the Planck box  which  Separates  Space from  hyperSpace. In order to get to point (e) from the momentum of the water molecule, a Second circle is added to the momentum.

0021 Referring to FIG.  8, a circle (I), centered on the water  molecule mass  at the speed  of  light  circle (i), is made tangent  to the Planck  wavelength at point  (e). The  momen tum  M of  space  is  equal  to  the Planck  mass  times  the  Planck Scale times  the Speed  of  light.  At  point  (e), the  speed  of  light

is unity, So that the momentum  is just the Planck mass in momentum  units:

<!-- image -->

Circle (I) has a radius equal to

<!-- image -->

Therefore the walking  momentum  in order  to get  to point  (e) is the momentum  of  Space M times this ratio

<!-- image -->

The  stride length L per  second  that a person of  mass  W has to walk  is the walking momentum  divided by the mass  W times a period  T of  one Second

<!-- image -->

For  a  person  with a mass  W of  99.79  kg  (220  pounds),  then the stride  length L  is 20.08 inches or one foot and eight inches. The  perSon  has  to walk  this  length  in one  Second  on each foot.

0022 Looking at the statue of  San Martin, his arms are crossed  over  each  other. The  Vortex  of  the right  hand  points backward,  and  the left hand  vortex  points  forward  due  to the reversed rotation. Referring to FIG.  9, this creates a rota tional energy channel (D) around his body  (A). The  stride length  (C)  is  calculated  according  to  the  body  mass,  and  then a banner  printout  is made  showing  where  the footprints  (B) are  to  be  placed each second. The question  is:  'What happens when one walks the walk'?'.

0023. On  the very  first experiment, referring  to FIG.  10, what happens is that, after taking only Six Strides on the banner printout (A), a huge spinning vortex (C) develops over  the top of  the head  and  the vertex  locks  onto the heart vortex in the center of  the chest (B). In  everyday life, this Vortex  is not  created  because normal  walking  is much  faster and the hands are held at the side of the body. The  energy rush through the pineal gland is So intense that one feels immediately sleepy and Starts yawning  excessively due to the increased flow of  melatonin.

0024. After practicing with the  banner printout,  long walks were made through the park. In this case, a vertical white line rotated around a vertical axis located about Six feet  perpendicular to the path on  the right  Side of  the body. When  the walking  speed  was  correct, this white line would lock onto the centerline of  the body. Speeding  up or down caused the white line  to  lose Synchronization and rotate away.  This  white line is related to the ability to levitate the body. San Martin had So much energy that, according to witness  testimony,  he  could  float horizontally  in  the air with his  head  resting  against  the  bowed head  of  Christ  on  a  carved Wooden croSS.  Thus San Martin's energy  Sources  were channeling  energy from Christ, collective broom  energy as described in a separate patent application, and the walking momentum  Vortex energy.

0025. During the early part of  the 20th century, a man's parents were lying in bed  dying  of  tuberculosis. With their permission, he placed a weighing  Scale under each of  their beds. When they passed away, he found that each Scale registered a  loSS  in weight  of  2.5  ounces.  This is equivalent to 0.071 kg, which is the mass  of  the human  energy being.

0026. After conducting a number of experiments with water Vortices draining from a cylindrical tank, it can be Stated from Bernoulli's theorem that the potential energy plus the kinetic energy is a constant

<!-- image -->

The shape of  the inner Surface of  the water circulation has a Velocity proportional to the inverse of  the radius, So the shape of the Surface is

<!-- image -->

which  says  that  the  height  of  the  vortex  is  proportional  to  the inverse of  the Square of  the radius.

0027. The  hand  vortex  area ratio between  the  second  test Subject and the third test Subject is equal to the Square of their radii:

<!-- image -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Because the Speed  of  light at the boundary was  determined to be one meter per Second, the energy of the third test Subject is

<!-- image -->

0028 Referring to  FIG. 11,  a circle  (K), having this radius, is added  to the energy  of  the water  molecule (E), to produce augmented energy circle (J). This circle (J) inter sects  the mass  of  the water  molecule  outside the Planck  box at  point  ().  This  means  that  the  increased  hyperspace  energy moves the  water molecule, and hence the body, out of dimension. Furthermore,  circle (J) is tangent to the walking momentum  ratio circle (I) which  keeps  the geometry  locked together.

## SUMMARY  OF  THE  INVENTION

0029. It is the object  of  this invention  to  create a training System that allows a person to develop the ability to walk

around  out  of  dimension,  passing  through  Solid  objects.  This invention is based on one of  the most remarkable relation ships  between  the water  molecule  and  the  boundary  between Space and hyperSpace. The mass of the water molecule is equal to the energy of  the water molecule at this boundary. Because the body  is composed of 67%  water, the body  sits on  the  boundary  Such  that any additional increase in energy would move the body out of dimension into hyperSpace. Because  human beings  are  actually  hyperspace  energy beings  living  in  physical bodies,  the  additional  energy required to move the body out of dimension comes from increasing  the  energy  of  the  hyperSpace  being.  One  Source  of this  energy comes  from  walking  cross-handed at the proper Velocity  in  order to  generate  a large  hyperSpace  energy vortex that flows energy into  the  potential  wells of the hyperSpace being. This increased hyperspace energy will then allow the person to walk around out of dimension through Solid  wooden doors.  Because the  door and the perSon are in two  slightly different dimensions  at the same moment, it appears that the perSon is walking through the door. After  passing  through  the closed  door, the  person  then returns to our dimension and  emerges  in the interior of  the closed-door room.

0030 This technique can be used in reverse to heal an infected  hand  instantaneously.  A  Salve  made  from  the St.Mary's herb is applied to the skin of  the infected hand. The hyperSpace energy then flows through the right-hand Vortex Such that the infected hand and the Salve are taken slightly out of  dimension. What  happens  is similar to when a  short piece  of Straw  is  embedded in  a  hard wooden telephone pole as a tornado  passes  over  the pole. The  Straw and pole are taken out of  dimension Such that they briefly merge  together.  AS  the tornado  moves  on,  both  objects  come back to dimension merged together. Thus  the Salve (Straw) is merged with the bacteria (pole) in hyperspace Such that the bacteria is killed instantly. Removing  the hand vortex brings the infected hand  back into dimension cured.

0.031 Based  on  this information and  the results of  many experiments,  this  invention  creates  a  large  Vortex  by  walking at a certain Velocity with the hands  crossed  over the chest. The proper walking momentum is created by a computer program  that  inputs  the  perSons  weight,  shoe  length,  and  the number  of  Strides to be taken. The  program then prints out a  banner  showing  the footprints  where  the  person  has  to  Step each  Second. When  a perSon obtains Sufficient energy from these  methods, the perSon is then tuned to the Subspace geometry of  the universe as will be shown  using the tetra hedron physics diagram.

## DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE INVENTION

0.052 1. Referring  to FIG.  12,  a  tetrahedron  (A,  path  abc) is added  to the diagram.  The  tip of  the tetrahedron (e) falls on the base constant which is equal to Planck's constant divided by  the speed  of  light. A second  tetrahedron  (B,  path def) is  inverted around horizontal line (D) which has a geometrical relationship to the base constant. The line is located at

<!-- image -->

Notice that the intersection of  the two  inverted  tetrahedrons (g) occurs at the Planck wavelength which is the boundary between  space  and  hyperspace.  Line  (D)  is referred  to  as  the merging of two worlds or the connecting  of  two worlds, a phrase obtained by means of remote Viewing. That  is, it is

the dividing line between  Space and  hyperSpace.  This  is the reason that the two  boundaries interSect at this point.

0053) Referring  to FIG.  13,  the  proton  wavelength  (E)  is added  to the diagram.  The  proton  wavelength  has  a  value of the electron wavelength divided by 1836.1527

<!-- image -->

A  line (hd), from the base  constant  at the proton  wavelength (h), to the corner of  the inverted tetrahedron (d), intersects the merging  of  two worlds line at point (i). A circle, with a radius  equal  to the Planck  mass  (G),  centered  (i), is tangent to the inverted tetrahedrons. Thus the proton is defined by the base  constant  and  the geometry  of  Subspace.  The  reason that  the  proton  is tangent  to  both  tetrahedrons  is  because  the electron and proton follow one Single path between Space and hyperSpace. Thus there is only one single particle in nature. Because the particle enters  our  Space  at two  different locations, we  see the one  particle as  two  distinct elementary particles. This relationship can  be seen in Library of  Con greSS tetrahedron diagram tet0565.

0054) Referring  to FIG.  14, the mass  of  the universe  MU is equal  to the linear mass  Q of  the  universe times  the radius R  of  the universe which  is 10°  meters

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

as shown on the diagram as line (A). The electron wave length (B) reflects off the circumscribing sphere (H) and returns  as  the  electron  mass (C). The distance  between reflection points  is the hyperspace charge which  is equal  to the charge of  Space less the electron  charge. So  the electron goes  from  wavelength  to electric  charge  to mass.  The  proton wavelength (D) reflects off the sphere and returns as the proton mass  (E)  which  intersects  the horizontal axis  at  point (c).  A line (abc)  from  the mass  of  the universe  at  the vertical axis  (a) to the proton  at the horizontal axis  (c) intersects the electron  (b)  which  determines  the  electron's  mass and wavelength  since this  point  is on  the  45 base  line. What  this means is  that  cosmology determines  the  values  of the elementary particles.

0055 Referring to FIG. 15, the mass  of  the water mol ecule  (C)  intersects  the  45 base  line  at  point  (a).  A circle  (F), with a radius equal to the Planck mass is centered on  point (c) at the Planck wavelength boundary (B) where the mass of  the water molecule numerically equals the energy of  the water molecule and where the Speed of light is unity. The Planck mass is tangent to the base constant which is the vertical centerline (I) of  the diagram. The  large circle (H), centered  (a) on  the water  molecule,  is tangent  to the mass  of the universe (b) and  tangent to the inverted tetrahedron (E). The  difference between  this  circle (H)  and  the base  constant (I)  is  the  energy  the  hyperspace  being  has  to  acquire in  order to be tuned to the mass and geometry of Subspace. This difference, shown  as  circle (G), has a mass

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus the hand  Vortex radius ratio has to be the Square root of  the mass  of  the hyperSpace energy  being  divided  by this tangent mass, or:

<!-- image -->

which is a Vortex radius that is three times larger than that of  a normal  perSon,  but  one inch  Smaller  than the third test subject  who  had  a  hand  vortex  radius  of  4  inches.  This  is  the reason that the third test Subject was  able to walk  through walls  and  teleport  to other  locations  because  his  energy was Sufficiently large enough  to croSS over  the inverted tetrahe dron into a co-dimension of hyperSpace. Notice also that dotted  circle (J) with a  radius  equal  to the mass  of  the water molecule, centered (c) on the boundary, is tangent to the tetrahedron  (K).  This  makes  the  combined  geometry  tangent to the inverted tetrahedrons and the mass  of  the universe.

0056 2.  Referring  to  FIG. 16,  a  computer program generates  a  banner  printout  with  footprints  spaced  for walk ing according  to the weight, shoe size and  length of  banner desired.  Some  banners  could  fit in  a  Small  room,  or  be  placed on the  floor  of a  long corridor.  As shown in  the  block diagram the program inputs these three variables with error checking. Then the program calculates the Stride length L per Second from the equation

<!-- image -->

0057 3. In the above equation,  the value of  the momen tum M,  as determined  by the tetrahedron diagram, is pref erably 50.9095736 kg m/s. The weight of the person is converted to  mass W  in  kilograms. The stride period is preferably  1  second.  Referring to  FIG. 17,  the  data  is entered in the dialog input window.

0058 4. Once the stride length has been calculated, the program displays the Stride length and  the required number of  banner  sheets  in  the message  window,  as  seen  in FIG.  18.

0059) 5. The print banner menu is selected and  the foot prints are printed on continuous  banner  paper. A Six-Stride Scaled  Screen  version  of  the  banner  is  shown  in FIG.  19.  The banner paper is then placed on the floor, and  a one-Second beeping timer is activated from the toolbar or menu. The person then walks  beside the printed  foot  prints, taking  one Stride  per  beep,  which  produces  the  correct  walking  momen tum to generate the hyperSpace Vortex. The Vortex, which forms in  only  Six  Strides,  brings  additional  hyperSpace energy into the quantum potential Wells of  the hyperSpace energy being.

0060 6. A  help system consists of a project tree which explains the  various Steps in using the program. Double mouse clicking on a project tree  node displays the help instructions in a dialog window as shown  in FIG.  20.

0061 7. In summary,  the purpose of  the training system is to Substantially increase  the  energy  of  a  human  being  who will then  have  the  capability  of  walking  through  walls,  body levitation,  instantaneous  healing  of infections,  full-body teleportation  to another location, remote viewing at  vast distances in terms of light-years, and looking into hyper

Space co-dimensions. The  third test Subject  and  I have  been able  to  experience  all  the  above  phenomena.  He did it through augmenting  his energy, and I have done  it through the application of  electromagnetic  fields,  by  Spinning  on  my Vortex accelerator machine and using this invention.

I  claim:
