## MCP Server (AI Integration)

GhostDance supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows AI tools like Cursor, Claude Desktop, or Cline to use the Ghost Dance calculation directly as a tool.

### How to use in Cursor:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have `gradio[mcp]` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install "gradio[mcp]"
    ```
2.  **Run the App**: Start the GhostDance application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The app will start the web UI and the MCP server. Look for the MCP SSE URL in the console (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse`).

3.  **Configure Cursor**:
    *   Open Cursor Settings.
    *   Navigate to **Features** -> **MCP**.
    *   Click **+ Add New MCP Server**.
    *   **Name**: `GhostDance`
    *   **Type**: `sse`
    *   **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse`

Once configured, you can ask Cursor to "Calculate Ghost Dance stride for a weight of 180 lbs" and it will use the tool automatically.
